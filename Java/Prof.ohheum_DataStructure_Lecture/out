A 5
wonderful 1
serenity 1
has 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 11
my 5
entire 1
soul, 1
like 2
these 1
sweet 1
mornings 1
spring 1
which 2
I 11
enjoy 1
with 3
whole 1
heart. 1
am 2
alone, 1
and 7
feel 3
the 20
charm 1
existence 1
in 3
this 1
spot, 1
was 2
created 1
for 1
bliss 1
souls 1
mine. 1
so 2
happy, 1
dear 1
friend, 1
absorbed 1
exquisite 1
sense 1
mere 1
tranquil 1
existence, 1
that 2
neglect 1
talents. 1
should 1
be 1
incapable 1
drawing 1
single 1
stroke 1
at 1
present 1
moment; 1
yet 1
never 1
greater 1
artist 1
than 1
now. 1
When, 1
while 1
lovely 1
valley 1
teems 1
vapour 1
around 1
me, 1
meridian 1
sun 1
strikes 1
upper 1
surface 1
impenetrable 1
foliage 1
trees, 1
but 1
few 1
stray 1
gleams 1
steal 1
into 1
inner 1
sanctuary, 1
throw 1
myself 1
down 1
among 2
tall 1
grass 1
by 2
trickling 1
stream; 1
and, 1
as 1
lie 1
close 1
to 1
earth, 1
thousand 1
unknown 1
plants 1
are 1
noticed 1
me: 1
when 1
hear 1
buzz 1
little 1
world 1
stalks, 1
grow 1
familiar 1
countless 1
indescribable 1
forms 1
insects 1
flies, 1
then 1
presence 1
Almighty, 1
who 1
formed 1
us 1
his 1
own 1
image, 1
breath 1
